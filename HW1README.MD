Changes I'm making to the homework:

In HTML, I changed all of the non semantic html to semantic html by changing the "divs" to "sections." 

In HTML, I positioned the "Title" element before the link to the css. 

In HTML, I added one line of space between each different section. 

In HTML, I changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon"

In HTML, I added alt attributes to each image to describe image for those who are unable to see it. 

In HTML, I changed the header attribute at the bottom of the page from h2 to h4 in order to make it in sequential order.
In CSS, I then added a "H4" and made the font 24px to match the font size of h2's default font size, which was the initial desired font size. Additionally, I deleted CSS for the .footer h2 class which made the font the desired size.

In HTML, I removed unecessary ID's that are already accounted for in a class. 

In HTML, I changed the seo class to a seo ID since it only occurs once on the webpage. 
In HTML, I changed the hero class to a hero ID since it only occurs once on the webapge. 

In CSS, I changed .header h1 to just h1 b/c its an html element that can be called by CSS on its own. 

In CSS, I am reorganizing the order of the classes and id's to match the order of the html. 

Inc CSS, consolidated .header section class.

In CSS, consolidated the H3's. 

In CSS, consolidated the H2's.
